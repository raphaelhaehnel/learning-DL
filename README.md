### Regression task
> We are working with tensors and training simple linear regression models using PyTorch.
> We generate and preprocess synthetic data, define two variations of a linear regression model, and train them using gradient descent.
> The training process is visualized through loss plots, and the trained model parameters are saved for further use.

### Classification task
> We generate synthetic circular data, split it into training and testing sets, and define two variations of a feedforward neural network.
> The models are trained using the binary cross-entropy loss function and optimized with Adam.
> We track loss values and accuracy during training and visualize decision boundaries to evaluate performance.

### Classification on 4 classes
> Trains a neural network to classify points in a spiral dataset.
> It generates synthetic data, splits it into training and testing sets, and trains a fully connected neural network using PyTorch.
> The model learns to separate the classes through iterative optimization, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.
> Finally, the decision boundary and loss progression are visualized.

> Trains and evaluates deep learning models using PyTorch to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset.
> Implementing various neural network architectures and visualizing performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices.
